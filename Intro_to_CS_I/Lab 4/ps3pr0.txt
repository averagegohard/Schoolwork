1. The most interesting part of the article to me was proabbly Dr Qian's game.
This was a very unique way to determine if we can store and access information from a "computer" smaller than no other.
Additionally, this basic design of using fluorescent proteins could pave the way to future developments in the field.
What is most interesting about this, however, is that the implications of such a "game" could really create a large impact with a volume of a cubic micron.
Soon, we may use biology instead of chemistry to make computers better.

2.The kinds of programs solved by the DNA is similar to the powers_of function we made in problem set two.
The DNA computer can, instead of solving for the powers of numbers, determine the square root of numbers.
Still, both take a number or two as input, perform some sort of simple process to the number until a desire output is reached. 
Afterwards, they display their output.
With regards to Dr Qian's game, it seems similar to the scrabble_score function we wrote in that the responses by the scientists were proabably given weights, which were then processed.
