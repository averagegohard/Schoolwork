1. The "most preventable" aspect of the bug would be the fact that the "backup" unit had the same exact software in my opinion. 
I don't understand why they trusted that their backup software would work any better than their original software. 
Indeed, it seems quite silly that they overlooked the possibility of a software failure. 
They should have at least tested their software before running the rocket and determine the errors while testing the software.

2. I agree with this statement wholeheartedly.
Hardware is influenced by a plethora of outside forces and many factors that humans can't neccessarily understand to its fullest extent.
Software, however, is 100% made by humans.
Thus, if software does not function as intended, it cannot possibily be a problem with outside forces at all, but the programmers themselves should be at fault.
While hardware problems could be caused by human error, software problems are always caused by human error.
